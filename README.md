Every job seeker—every person—has their own top priority—money, workload, colleagues, reputation, fascination, or power. We can't forcibly change someone's deepest desires. Trickery only makes them temporarily forget their true needs, leading them down a detour. What we should really do is challenge market biases and present the facts to those making decisions in the moment.  

Sometimes, I have a strong intuition about whether a match is right. Whether this happens before or after doesn’t matter—the outcome is inevitable. As a headhunter, I’m merely someone who has gathered enough information and, without any control over the process, happened to step into the right or not right moment to connect with you.
